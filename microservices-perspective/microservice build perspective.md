#  Perspective need to build [[microservice]].
- **The architect**—Sees the big picture, decomposes an application into individual
microservices, and then understands how the microservices interact to deliver a
solution.

 - **The software developer**—Writes the code and understands how the language and
*development frameworks* will be used to deliver a microservice.

- **The DevOps engineer**—Determines how the services are deployed and managed
throughout production and non-production environments. The watchwords
for the DevOps engineer are consistency and repeatability in every environment.
