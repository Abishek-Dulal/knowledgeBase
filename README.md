Map of the all the things I know.

## What to remember
I read a lot of books this year and I am coding and learning things but I had no way 
to hold all the information in my head . Rote learning is bad and I cannot remember all the 
things I learn . I found out zettelkasten and smart notes. 

### This repo is collection of things I read and my way to keep a second brain.
