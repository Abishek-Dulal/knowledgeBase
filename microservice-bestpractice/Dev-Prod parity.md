# Dev Prod Parity
This best practice refers to having different environments (for example, development,
staging, production) as analogous as possible. The environments should always con-
tain similar versions of deployed code, as well as the infrastructure and services. This
can be done with continuous deployment, which automates the deployment process
as much as possible, allowing a microservice to be deployed between environments in
short periods of time.
