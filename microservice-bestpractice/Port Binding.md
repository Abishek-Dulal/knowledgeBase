# Port Binding
Port binding means to publish services through a specific port. In a microservices
architecture, a microservice is completely self-contained with the run-time engine for
the service packaged in the service executable. You should run the service without the
need for a separate web or application server. The service should start by itself on the
command line and be accessed immediately through an exposed HTTP port.
