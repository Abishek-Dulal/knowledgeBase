The Docker networks allow us to attach the containers to as
many networks as we like. We can see the networks as a means to communicate
with isolated containers. Docker contains the following five network driver
types: bridge , host , overlay , none , and macvlan


docker running on same network can work with container name instead of the 
port and host.
