# Docker is a container tool
A VM is a software environment that allows us to emulate the operation of a com-
puter within another computer. These are based on a hypervisor that emulates the
complete physical machine, allocating the desired amount of system memory, proces-
sor cores, disk storage, and other technological resources such as networks, PCI add-
ons, and so forth.


A Container is a package that contains a virtual
operating system (OS) that allows us to run an application with its dependent ele-
ments in an isolated and independent environment
